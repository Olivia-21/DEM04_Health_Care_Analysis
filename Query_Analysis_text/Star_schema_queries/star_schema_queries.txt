QUESTION 1
SQL QUERY:

SELECT
  d.year,
  d.month,
  s.specialty_name,
  et.encounter_type_name,
  COUNT(*) AS total_encounters
FROM fact_encounters f
JOIN dim_date d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
JOIN dim_specialty s ON f.specialty_key = s.specialty_key
JOIN dim_encounter_type et ON f.encounter_type_key = et.encounter_type_key
GROUP BY d.year, d.month, s.specialty_name, et.encounter_type_name;


Execution Time Estimate: 44ms vs 47ms
Improvement factor: 1x faster
Explanation
Ans: The query joins a small number of dimension tables, metrics such as encounter counts is calculated during ETL, eliminating expensive runtime aggregation and relies on indexed surrogate keys instead of aggregating over normalized transactional tables.


QUESTION 2
SQL QUERY:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
  bd.diagnosis_code,
  bp.procedure_code,
  COUNT(*) AS encounter_count
FROM bridge_encounter_diagnoses bd
JOIN bridge_encounter_procedures bp
  ON bd.encounter_key = bp.encounter_key
GROUP BY bd.diagnosis_code, bp.procedure_code;


Execution Time Estimate: 58.1ms vs 229ms
Improvement factor: 4x faster
Explanation



QUESTION 3
SQL QUERY:

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
  s.specialty_name,
  COUNT(*) AS readmissions
FROM fact_encounters f1
JOIN fact_encounters f2
  ON f1.patient_key = f2.patient_key
 AND f2.date_key BETWEEN f1.date_key AND f1.date_key + 30
JOIN dim_specialty s
  ON f1.specialty_key = s.specialty_key
WHERE f1.encounter_type_key = 2
GROUP BY s.specialty_name;

SELECT
  d.year,
  d.month,
  s.specialty_name,
  SUM(f.total_allowed_amount) AS revenue
FROM fact_encounters f
JOIN dim_date d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
JOIN dim_specialty s ON f.specialty_key = s.specialty_key
GROUP BY d.year, d.month, s.specialty_name;
